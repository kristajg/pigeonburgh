			Her story makes you a bit sad in your core. It's lame that such a creative person should burn themselves out over
			sometimes elses biz, but you see she has certainly built quite a portfolio out of it.

			You think maybe everyone has to put in those hell-grindy hours and get ultra dissatisfied before bustin' out like

			You tell her, "Ira. That sucks major tail! You are a cool person with the drive and know-how to destroy a
			small-to-medium sized planet. Destroy it with the power of your art! You got this."
