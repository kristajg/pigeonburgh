    You decide the Supercomputing Center is the center for all things super and computing. Seeing as this binary code probably definitely relates to computers, you decide to check it out.
    <br />
    <br />
    On your way to the center, you notice a new restaurant opening up on the Northside next to an old deli.
    <br />
    <br />
    That deli was cool. They put banana peppers on every sandwich. The old deli man there called every girl that came in Dorothy, and every guy Donnie.
    <br />
    <br />
    Thatâ€™s the kind of world I want to live in, forever.
